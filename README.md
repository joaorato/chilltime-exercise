# chilltime-exercise
This is my proposed solution for the Chilltime Remote Technical Exercise about a Flip Card game.

This solves Exercise A and has a small attempt on B. I didn't know the timeframe I had for the exercise and, as such, I felt it was best to send at least one of the parts made.

This was my first experience with React JS and CSS, so I already learned quite a bit. However, I still feel the solution has room for improvement. Obviously the graphical aspect could be a lot better but also the fact that when a card was wrongly picked it was never shown (hindering the game for the player).

I mainly edited the /src/components/ files, having made most of the logic in Game.js.
